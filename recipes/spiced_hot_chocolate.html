        <img class="chocolate-image" src="../images/hot-choco.jpg" alt="Mug of hot chocolate">
    <h4>A warm and spicy chocolate drink, its origins dating back to ancient Mexico's civilizations the Aztecs and Mayans</h4>

        <p>This decadent drink is for the nights that are too frigid to step foot outside but that nagging craving for a cold chocolate dessert won't fade away. Instead of a cold dessert this thick and warm hot chocolate is the perfect substitute for satisfying that chocolate craving. The recipe is fairly simple and can be made using ingredients that are commonly found in one's pantry. Spices such as cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg along with whole milk or your milk of choice and lastly, cocoa powder. The milk and spices are then whisked in a saucepan and once simmering it is ready.</p>
